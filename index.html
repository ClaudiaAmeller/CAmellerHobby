            <h1>Why Photography?</h1>
            <p>Photography has turned into a passion for so many people since it was invented back in the 1800’s. It’s fun, challenging, and you get to be creative!
                <br>The most <span style="font-weight: bold;"> exciting</span> thing about photography is all the super cool gear you get to buy! Every year <span style="font-style: italic;">Nikon, Canon, and Sony</span> release fancy new equipment to make your photo-taking easier:
                <ol>
                    <li>DSLR cameras</li>
                    <li>Lenses</li>
                    <li>Gadgets</li>
                </ol>  
            </p>
            <p>
                There is landscape and nature photography, family and baby portraits, sports, events, documentary, drone photography, and still life photography! There are a lot of options within this one field to pick from and you’re not going to LOVE every one. Your best bet is trying a little bit of everything and figuring out where your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">passion truly lies</span>. Do you love photographing flowers? Maybe you can’t get enough of taking photos of babies. Or you simply prefer to melt into the background and document things as they are. Be true to yourself and your personality and take the time to find the one very specific area of photography that makes your heart sing.
                <br>And I know the joy that photography brings to many people in this world because I see them documenting their vacations, family outings, and any other important time in their life. But I’m also seeing people going out and buying fancy cameras and then using them on Auto just like their cell phone. The greatest gratification you can have when it comes to photography is the feeling that you were responsible for capturing that amazing photograph don’t let your camera take the credit. Learn your craft, dedicate yourself to your hobby, and create some beautiful art!
